      About Me
    </h2>
     <p>
I've been coding for just over a year. I am comfortable with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Python. I also have some experience with C++ and I have worked with Arduinos. 
    </p>
    <p>
In my free time, I like to paint and bike ride. I also like to play with my two dogs, Bridget and Daisy. My favorite place to be is the beach.    
    </p>
    <p>
When I go to college, I would like to major in Computer Science. My top three choices for college at the moment are USC, Cal Poly SLO, and Stevens Institute of Technology. All three schools have excellent CS programs. 
    </p>
    <p> 
At school, I am the co-president of two clubs, Girls Who Code and Asian Culture Club. Both clubs are very important to my identity as a minority in technology and in my community. 
    </p>
    <p>
Over the summer, I was a TA for Girls Who Code. This job opportunity taught me more about coding and about people in general. The seven weeks I was a TA confirmed my passion for CS and what I want to be once I graduate college.
